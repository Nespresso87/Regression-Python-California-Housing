# Regression-Python-California-Housing
The primary objective of this project is to understand the relationship between various features and house prices in California, and to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on these features. The evaluation metrics, particularly the MSE, help determine the model's effectiveness in making accurate predictions.
